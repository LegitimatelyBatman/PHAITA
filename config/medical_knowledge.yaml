  clinical_notes: 'These modifiers are based on clinical evidence but should be used
    for

    educational and research purposes only. Real clinical decision-making

    requires comprehensive patient assessment, physical examination,

    and appropriate diagnostic testing.


    Comorbidity effects are multiplicative with baseline symptom probabilities

    and are capped at 0.95 to maintain realistic distributions.


    Interaction effects supersede individual comorbidity effects when

    multiple conditions are present.
