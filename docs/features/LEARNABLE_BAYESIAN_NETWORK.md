# Learnable Bayesian Network Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of learnable weights for the BayesianSymptomNetwork, allowing symptom probabilities to be optimized via gradient descent instead of using hardcoded values.

## Problem Statement
The original `BayesianSymptomNetwork` used fixed probabilities:
- Primary symptoms: 0.8 (80% chance)
- Severity symptoms: 0.4 (40% chance)

These hardcoded values were not optimized for medical accuracy and couldn't adapt during training.

## Solution
Created a learnable variant that:
1. Uses PyTorch `nn.Parameter` for gradient-based optimization
2. Maintains medically plausible ranges through constraint loss
3. Integrates seamlessly with the existing adversarial training pipeline
4. Preserves backward compatibility with the original implementation

## Implementation Details

### 1. LearnableBayesianSymptomNetwork (`phaita/models/bayesian_network.py`)

**Architecture:**
```python
class LearnableBayesianSymptomNetwork(nn.Module):
    # Learnable parameters
    primary_symptom_logit: nn.Parameter  # logit(0.8) ≈ 1.386
    severity_symptom_logit: nn.Parameter  # logit(0.4) ≈ -0.405
    condition_weights: nn.Parameter  # [num_conditions, 2]
```

**Key Features:**
- Extends `nn.Module` for PyTorch integration
- Sigmoid activation ensures probabilities stay in [0, 1]
- Per-condition adjustments allow fine-tuning for specific diseases
- Only ~22 parameters for 10 conditions (<1KB memory)

**Methods:**
- `get_probabilities(condition_code)`: Returns learnable probabilities with adjustments
- `sample_symptoms(condition_code, num_symptoms)`: Uses learned probabilities
- `get_symptom_probability(condition_code, symptom)`: Returns probability for specific symptom
- `get_conditional_probabilities(condition_code)`: Returns all symptom probabilities

### 2. MedicalAccuracyLoss (`phaita/utils/medical_loss.py`)

**Purpose:** Guides the learnable network to maintain medically plausible symptom distributions.

**Loss Components:**

1. **Alignment Loss** (weight: 1.0)
   - Measures how well sampled symptoms match expected patterns
   - Penalizes incorrect symptoms for a condition
   - Formula: `(1 - correct_ratio) + incorrect_ratio`

2. **Constraint Loss** (weight: 0.5)
   - Keeps probabilities in reasonable medical ranges
   - Primary target: 0.8 (range: 0.6-0.95)
   - Severity target: 0.4 (range: 0.2-0.6)
   - Formula: MSE against target + weight regularization

3. **Diversity Loss** (weight: 0.3)
   - Prevents all conditions from having identical distributions
   - Encourages per-condition specialization
   - Formula: `-log(variance(condition_weights) + 1e-8)`

**Total Loss:**
```
L_total = α * L_alignment + β * L_constraint + γ * L_diversity
```

### 3. AdversarialTrainer Integration (`phaita/training/adversarial_trainer.py`)

**New Parameters:**
- `use_learnable_bayesian` (default: `False`) - Enable learnable mode
- `bayesian_lr` (default: `1e-3`) - Learning rate for Bayesian optimizer
- `medical_accuracy_weight` (default: `0.2`) - Weight for medical loss

**Training Flow:**
```
For each epoch:
    For step in [1, 2, 3, ..., 10]:
        # Step 1-10: Train discriminator
        disc_losses = train_discriminator_step(...)
        
        # Step 2, 4, 6, 8, 10: Train generator
        if step % 2 == 0:
            gen_losses = train_generator_step(...)
        
        # Step 3, 6, 9: Train Bayesian network
        if use_learnable_bayesian and step % 3 == 0:
            bayesian_losses = train_bayesian_step(...)
```

**New Methods:**
- `train_bayesian_step(batch_size)`: Trains learnable network for one step
- Returns detailed loss components for logging

**Checkpoint Management:**
- Saves/loads Bayesian network state
- Includes optimizer state for resume training

### 4. Testing (`tests/test_learnable_bayesian.py`)

**Test Coverage:**
1. **test_learnable_bayesian_network()**
   - Parameter initialization and gradient computation
   - Probability retrieval with constraints
   - Symptom sampling with learned probabilities
   - Optimization step and parameter updates

2. **test_medical_accuracy_loss()**
   - Loss computation with correct/incorrect symptoms
   - Loss component breakdown
   - Gradient flow verification

3. **test_adversarial_trainer_integration()**
   - SymptomGenerator with learnable network
   - Presentation generation

### 5. Demo Script (`demos/learnable_network_demo.py`)

**Features:**
- Interactive demonstration of learnable network training
- Shows initial and final probabilities
- Displays loss evolution over 20 iterations
- Compares symptom sampling before/after training

**Output:**

   Primary symptom probability: 0.800
   Severity symptom probability: 0.400

5. Training for 20 iterations...
   Iter   Loss       Primary    Severity

   5      5.5262     0.800      0.401     
   ...
```

## API Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from phaita.models.bayesian_network import LearnableBayesianSymptomNetwork

# Initialize
network = LearnableBayesianSymptomNetwork(device="cuda")

# Get probabilities
primary_prob, severity_prob = network.get_probabilities("J45.9")

# Sample symptoms
symptoms = network.sample_symptoms("J45.9", num_symptoms=5)
```

### Training with AdversarialTrainer
```python
from phaita.training.adversarial_trainer import AdversarialTrainer

trainer = AdversarialTrainer(
    use_learnable_bayesian=True,
    medical_accuracy_weight=0.2,
    bayesian_lr=1e-3
)

history = trainer.train(num_epochs=100, batch_size=16)
```

### Standalone Training
```python
import torch
from phaita.models.bayesian_network import LearnableBayesianSymptomNetwork
from phaita.utils.medical_loss import MedicalAccuracyLoss

# Setup
network = LearnableBayesianSymptomNetwork()
loss_fn = MedicalAccuracyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(network.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    # Sample symptoms
    symptoms = network.sample_symptoms("J45.9", num_symptoms=5)
    
    # Compute loss
    loss = loss_fn([symptoms], ["J45.9"], network)
    
    # Update weights
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

## Backward Compatibility

**Guaranteed compatibility:**
- Original `BayesianSymptomNetwork` unchanged
- All existing tests pass (test_basic.py: 4/4)
- Default behavior preserved (learnable mode is opt-in)
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

**Migration path:**
```python
# Old code (still works)
from phaita.models.bayesian_network import BayesianSymptomNetwork
network = BayesianSymptomNetwork()

# New code (opt-in)
from phaita.models.bayesian_network import LearnableBayesianSymptomNetwork
network = LearnableBayesianSymptomNetwork()
```

## Performance Characteristics

**Memory:**
- Standard network: <100KB (data structures)
- Learnable network: <1KB (22 parameters)

**Compute:**
- Standard network: O(1) probability lookup
- Learnable network: O(1) probability lookup + sigmoid
- Training overhead: Minimal (every 3rd step)

**Gradient computation:**
- Uses PyTorch autograd
- Gradients flow through sigmoid activations
- Proper gradient clipping applied
