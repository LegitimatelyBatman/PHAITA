# PHAITA Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Medical Triage Training System with Adversarial Architecture as specified in the project requirements.

## Architecture Implemented

### 1. Data Layer (`phaita/data/`)

#### `icd_conditions.py` - Medical Conditions Database
- **10 Respiratory Conditions** with ICD-10 codes:
  - J45.9: Asthma
  - J18.9: Pneumonia  
  - J44.1: COPD with Exacerbation
  - J06.9: Upper Respiratory Infection
  - R06.02: Shortness of Breath
  - J20.9: Acute Bronchitis
  - J42: Chronic Bronchitis
  - J93.9: Pneumothorax
  - J81.0: Pulmonary Edema
  - Z87.891: Personal History of Nicotine Dependence

- **Features**:
  - Primary symptoms for each condition
  - Severity indicators
  - Lay terminology (colloquial terms)
  - Comprehensive symptom database
  - Search and lookup utilities

#### `forum_scraper.py` - Forum Data Collection
- **Mock Reddit scraper** with realistic health forum posts
- **Lay Language Mapper** with bidirectional mapping:
  - Medical → Lay (dyspnea → "can't breathe")
  - Lay → Medical ("can't breathe" → dyspnea)
  - 7+ predefined medical term mappings
  - Learning capability from forum posts
  - Save/load functionality
- **Data Augmentation** with forum language integration
- **ForumPost dataclass** for structured post data

#### `synthetic_generator.py` - Synthetic Data Generation
- **Variation Generator**: Creates 1000+ variations per condition
- **Demographic Diversity**:
  - Education levels (low, medium, high)
  - Age groups (child, adult, elderly)
  - Emotional states (neutral, anxious, panicked)
- **Dataset Generation**:
  - Balanced datasets
  - Difficulty-based datasets (easy, medium, hard)
  - Configurable sizes and distributions

#### `preprocessing.py` - Data Pipeline
- **Text Preprocessor**:
  - Contraction expansion
  - Lowercasing
  - Tokenization
  - Keyword extraction
  - Stop word removal
- **Dataset Preprocessor**:
  - Train/val/test splitting
  - Balanced (stratified) splitting
  - Text and label extraction

### 2. Model Layer (`phaita/models/`)

#### `bayesian_network.py` - Bayesian Symptom Network
- **Probabilistic symptom sampling**
- **Conditional probabilities**:
  - Primary symptoms: 80% probability
  - Severity indicators: 30% probability
- **Configurable symptom counts** (2-6 symptoms)
- **Symptom-condition likelihood calculation**
- **Reverse lookup**: Find conditions by symptom

#### `enhanced_bayesian_network.py` - Advanced Features
- **Age-specific modifiers**:
  - Child: Higher fever, irritability
  - Adult: Standard presentation
  - Elderly: Higher confusion, lower fever
- **Severity modifiers**:
  - Mild: Fewer symptoms
  - Moderate: Standard presentation
  - Severe: More symptoms, forced severity indicators
- **Rare presentations**:
  - Silent asthma (no wheezing)
  - Cough-variant asthma
  - Walking pneumonia
  - Elderly confusion presentation
  - COPD with cachexia
- **Evidence sources** (GINA 2023, GOLD 2023, IDSA 2022)

#### `generator.py` - Symptom & Complaint Generator
- **SymptomGenerator**: Uses Bayesian network for symptom sampling
- **ComplaintGenerator**: Converts symptoms to patient language
  - 26+ lay language mappings
  - Multiple complaint templates (15+ variations)
  - Duration templates ("for days", "for hours")
  - Emotional templates ("I'm worried", "I'm scared")
  - Combination templates (multiple symptoms)
- **Language style variation**:
  - Education level adaptation
  - Age-appropriate language
  - Emotional state modulation

#### `discriminator.py` - Diagnosis System
- **Keyword-based diagnosis** (mock implementation)
- **Multi-condition scoring**
- **Confidence scores**
- **Uncertainty quantification**
- **PyTorch-compatible interface**

- **Template-based questions** for common symptoms:
  - Cough questions (4 variations)
  - Shortness of breath (4 variations)
  - Chest pain (4 variations)
  - Fever (4 variations)
  - Wheezing (4 variations)

- **Severity assessment questions**
- **Information gain calculation**
- **Patient style matching** (education level)
- **Conversation history tracking**

### 3. Training Infrastructure

## Example Usage

### Generate Synthetic Complaints
```python
from phaita.data import SyntheticDataGenerator

generator = SyntheticDataGenerator()
dataset = generator.generate_variations('J45.9', num_variations=100)
# Creates 100 varied asthma complaints with demographic diversity
```

### End-to-End Pipeline
```python
from phaita import SymptomGenerator, ComplaintGenerator, DiagnosisDiscriminator

# Generate symptoms
symptom_gen = SymptomGenerator()
symptoms = symptom_gen.generate_symptoms('J45.9')  # Asthma

# Create patient complaint
complaint_gen = ComplaintGenerator()
complaint = complaint_gen.generate_complaint(symptoms, 'J45.9')
# Output: "I've been wheezy and can't breathe for a few days"

# Diagnose
discriminator = DiagnosisDiscriminator()
predictions = discriminator.predict_diagnosis([complaint])
code, confidence = predictions[0]
```

### Interactive Triage
```python
from phaita.models import QuestionGenerator

qgen = QuestionGenerator()
symptoms = ['cough', 'fever', 'chest_pain']
question = qgen.generate_clarifying_question(symptoms)
# Output: "Is your cough dry or are you bringing up mucus?"
```

## Production Deployment Considerations

### To Enable Full Capabilities:
1. **Install PyTorch**: For actual neural network models
2. **Install Transformers**: For DeBERTa encoder
3. **Install PyTorch Geometric**: For Graph Neural Networks
4. **Replace mock discriminator**: With actual DeBERTa + GAT architecture
5. **Add Mistral-7B**: For advanced language generation
6. **Enable real forum scraping**: With Reddit API credentials
7. **Add training loop**: Execute adversarial training
8. **Add evaluation pipeline**: Track metrics during training

### Current vs. Production Architecture
