# PHAITA Project Summary

**Pre-Hospital AI Triage Algorithm**

## Overview

PHAITA is an innovative medical triage system that uses adversarial training to create robust diagnostic models capable of handling real-world patient language and challenging clinical presentations. The system combines Bayesian Networks, large language models, and graph neural networks to provide accurate medical triage without requiring real patient data.

## Core Innovation: Adversarial Training for Medical Triage

### The Problem
Traditional medical AI systems struggle with:
- **Lay Language**: Patients describe symptoms in non-medical terms
- **Sparse Data**: Limited labeled medical datasets
- **Distribution Shift**: Training data doesn't match real-world presentations
- **Edge Cases**: Rare and atypical presentations are underrepresented

### The Solution: Adversarial Medical Training
PHAITA addresses these challenges through a novel adversarial training paradigm:

1. **Generator**: Creates challenging, realistic patient complaints
2. **Discriminator**: Learns to diagnose from patient language
3. **Adversarial Loop**: Generator tries to fool discriminator, discriminator gets better at diagnosis
4. **Result**: Robust model that handles diverse, challenging presentations

## System Architecture

### Generator Pipeline
```
ICD-10 Code → Enhanced Bayesian Network → Symptoms → Language Model → Patient Complaint
```

**Components:**
- **Enhanced Bayesian Network**: Evidence-based symptom probabilities from medical literature
- **Language Model**: Mistral 7B (quantized) for natural language generation
- **Curriculum Learning**: Progressive training from synthetic to forum-derived language
- **Realism Scoring**: BERT-based assessment of complaint authenticity

### Discriminator Pipeline
```
Patient Complaint → DeBERTa Encoder → Text Features
Medical Knowledge → Graph Neural Network → Graph Features
                    ↓
            Fusion Layer → Diagnosis + Authenticity Score
```

**Components:**
- **DeBERTa Encoder**: Medical domain-adapted transformer
- **Medical Knowledge Graph**: Symptom relationships and dependencies
- **Graph Neural Network**: Leverages medical knowledge structure
- **Multi-task Learning**: Simultaneous diagnosis and authenticity detection

### Training Process
```
1. Forum Data Collection → Lay language mapping
2. Curriculum Learning → Synthetic → Mixed → Forum-heavy
3. Adversarial Training → Generator vs Discriminator
4. Realism Enhancement → BERT-based complaint scoring
5. Evaluation → Diversity, realism, medical consistency metrics
```
